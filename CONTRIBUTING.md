## Introduction
Please start by reading our [license](https://github.com/substation-beta/ssb_implementation/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE-2.0) and [code-of-conduct](https://github.com/substation-beta/ssb_implementation/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you don't agree with them, this isn't your project.

Before planning to post issues or request pulls, have a look at our templates:
* [Pull request template](https://github.com/substation-beta/ssb_implementation/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md)
* [Issue templates](https://github.com/substation-beta/ssb_implementation/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)

## Expectations
* We're **mentoring** but just to a certain degree. An initial effort should have been done, training in programming basics or computer science isn't part of the offer. We want to speed up development, not slowing it down.
* **Quality** has priority, not getting fastly done. Faults by unnecessary hurry or sentences like "at least it works" are the opposite of "being welcome" here. Putting experiments on users is disrespectful for their time investment.
* Don't get emotional, act logical. **Personal taste** has to back off if there's no explanation why _xy_ makes more sense for others too. Let's combine the best of all!
* **Comment &amp; document** your changes. Keep in mind others may work on same project parts too and don't want to spend much time understanding what you've done. 10 seconds you saved costs another contributor 10 minutes.
* Contributing should happen as **teamwork**, not as competition. Join discussions, look through PRs and issues, merge compatible forks. Ignoring the progress of others leads to lost time (and motivation).

## Style guideline
* Nothing comes through **untested**! Try to add tests for critical parts and at least 50%.
* **Comment** enough to leave no questions. In a perfect world code explains himself - _spoiler: we don't live in a perfect world!_
* You remember [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)? Less code = less maintenance effort. Keep your code clean (no zombies), optimize by a worthy cost-benefit balance and use standards instead of bloating with dependencies!
* Auto-format doesn't always result in most **readable code**! Review and format for humans.
* Continue present **conventions** and follow **best practices**. Don't break our pattern, code needs no multi-culture.
* Trust in **compiler warnings** and **clippy suggestions**. They mostly know better than you how good code looks like. Edit until your tools stop complaining.

## What we're looking for
* Bugfixes
* Feature ideas
* Tools (editors, plugins, pre- & post-processors, ...)
* Tutorials

## How to contribute
Main contribution ways are to [open issues](https://github.com/substation-beta/ssb_implementation/issues) and [fork with later pull requests](https://github.com/substation-beta/ssb_implementation/network/members).

Furthermore you can discuss issues, review PRs, develop supportive software, mention this project in public or chat with the community about your experience.

## Community
The community has a high value for this project!

As much as possible should be discussed in public, important decisions made by multiple individuals and people not getting excluded just because of a little dispute.

Those who actively contribute and follow the spirit of open source development get the chance to become organization members.
